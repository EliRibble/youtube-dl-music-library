# youtube-dl-music-library

This project is a simple tool that I wrote which allowed me to migrate out of YouTube Music. All it does is take the CSV you get from [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com) for YouTube Music and downloads all the songs listed in your library.

It's easy, convenient, and fun.

Sort of like other music services that aren't YouTube Music. Or how Google Music was.
